                    <p>I'm Adam and I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M</a>. I'm majoring in computer science with a focus area in business, and I plan on graduating in spring 2024.</p>
                    <p>I have always had a passion for solving problems and learning new things. Since I was a kid I was curious about how everything worked and knew that I wanted to demystify this universe that we live in. I eventually became interested in computers and built my own PC which was what sparked my initial interest in computer science. Computing has been a very abstract concept for most of my life but for the time that I have been here at A&M I have learned a lot and I feel ready to start applying my knowledge. </p>
                    <p>I want to join an innovative company that promotes creativity and collaboration and that has a purpose or principles that align with my own.</p>
                    <p>The way I live my life is really important to me, and I don't want to think of work and life being completely independent of each other. While I think boundaries are important, it is also important for me to love what I am doing because that is when I do my best work. My mission in both work and life comes down to a list of a few principles that may or may not change with time but should keep the same gist: Stay connected with reality, truth, and the present moment, be open to opportunities for growth or positive change, have the courage to question everything, push the boundaries of my knowledge and experience, and make consciousness a more pleasant and exciting experience for everyone.</p>
                    <p>Now that you know a bit more about me, make sure to check out the rest of my website where you will find my resume as well as other useful information about me.</p>
